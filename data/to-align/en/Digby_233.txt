                        After that by help of God we hauen iended the furste partie of pis firste
                            book in the whiche it is itreted of mannis owne gouernaunce, schewynge
                            wherinne kynges and princes schullen sette here felicite. For it is not
                            semelich for hem to sette here ende in riches noper in cyuil my3t and
                            strengthe, noper in no suche thinges; but he schal vse al suche thinges,
                            as it is proued tofore atte folle, as instrumentis and inuen[cliones for
                            to come to felicitee. Pei schullen sette here felicite in dede of
                            prudencia, as that dede cometh of charite. For thanne kynges hauen
                            felicite accordyng to here astate, whanne by excityng of [d]eleccioun of
                            God, they rulen hem that bien vnder hem holilyche and rightfulliche by
                            prudencia of regnynge and by lawe of resoun. Thanne the felicite of
                            kynges schal be principalliche iset in God. And by knowyng and loue of
                            hym he schal ordeyne here studie and here lif perto, that bei mowe knowe
                            and loue God and rule the poeple that is vnder ham as verrey Goddes
                            seruauntes by ordre of resoun.
                        Thanne, for pis is treted, and it is schewed where inne kynges schal
                            sette here ende and felicite by the ordre that is isette, now it is to
                            schewyng in what vertues kynges schal be excellent and vertuous by
                            certeyn hey3tyng and perfeccioun of the soule. Perfore it nedeth firste
                            to schewe whiche bien the vertual poten|cie and my3tes of the soule and
                            in col. 2 whiche my3tes be vertues bien igrounded and ipi3t. And thanne
                            it schal be ischewed how the vertues bien distingued. Perafter we schal
                            declare how many suche vertues ber bien and whiche perof is principale,
                            and whiche is secundary, and thanne we schal trete singulerlich of
                            eueriche of these vertues and how it semeth kynges and princes to haue
                            suche vertues.
                        The vertual my3tes of the soule mowe be destyngued in these wise: for som
                            bien kynde and natural, and some cognitif and sensitif, and some
                            appetitif, and some intellectual. In natural my3tes of the soule we
                            communeth with herbes and treen, as in vertual my3t of norsching, of
                            wexinge, and of gendrynge, and in suche as corden to herbes and treen.
                            The my3tes of sensitif knowyng and felyng be the si3t, tast, and
                            touche,
                        and the oper wittes, and berinne we accordeb wip oper bestes. The
                            appetitif is destyngued, for oon appetit is in man and not in oper
                            bestes as the appetit that foloweth the intellectual inwit. And anoper
                            maner appetit is in man and in beste, as the appetite that foloweth the
                            felyng, and suche appetite may be cleped sensualitas. And the appetit
                            that foloweth the intellectual inwit is icleped voluntas, the wille. And
                            in that manere of speche oper bestes hauen the appetite that hatte
                            sensualitas and appetitus sensitiuus, and haueth not the appetite that
                            hatte voluntas, the intellectual wille.
                        Thanne the vertues of the whiche we thinketh to speke bien goode habites,
                            that is dwellyng places; outhir thai bien in the natural vertual my3tes,
                            oper in the vertual my3tes and wittes of felyng, oper in the appetite
                            sensitif of felyng, oper in | the appetite intellectual, oper in the
                            intellecte and inwyt, oper in al bes, oper in some perof. And a mowe not
                            be in natural vertual mizttes and that is declared in pre wise.
                            [Firste,] for we bep noust preysed nober iblamed for naturel and kynde
                            vertue, for no man is acounted a good man for he hath good degestioun
                            and wexinge. The seconde, suche vertues bep noust in the naturel vertual
                            my3tes, for suche vertues stonden by resoun as it may be preued, ii
                            Ethicorum, and natural my3tes bien not obedient to resoun in that bei
                            bien soche. For bei a man make resouns wheper he wil oper no,
                            properliche for to speke the natural potencial vertues varieth not in
                            here kynde worchynge but wercheth alwey with al here my3t. The pridde,
                            habites and vertues bien not in natural uertual my3tes, for suche
                            habites and vertues inclineth potencial vertues to do wel oper euel, as
                            a vicious habite inclyneth to do euel, and as a vertuous habite
                            inclineth to do wel. Thanne for kynde is inclyned and determined to oon,
                            and potencial vertues bien fol inclyned by kynde to worche by here owne
                            kynde, and so perby we bep noper vertuous ne vicious as we speketh heere
                            of vertueus and of vices; and so perinne may not be suche vertues.
                        And by the same pre resouns by the whiche it is preued that vertuees bien
                            not in the natural potencial vertues, it may be preued that bei bien not
                            in the knowyng of the fif wittes. For as we ben nou3t ipreysed nober
                            iblamed for natural potencial vertues, so we ben not ipreysed noper
                            iblamed for the fife wittes; for as no man is preysed for a gode man for
                            he hap a gode digestion and wexyng, so man is no3t presed for scharp
                            si3t and gode hiryng, but if it fallep by hap oper yf a man is ble|r
                            ey3ed and his si3t apeired for greet etyng and drynkyng, oper 3if he
                            hath euel digestioun or feblenesse of stomachus for etyng, aliter he
                            schold be blamed for ouer mych drinkyng, aliter, and nou3t for he hath
                            yuel dygestioun, nober for feble si3t ‡‡ - for scharp sight and good
                            digestioun [is not] in oure power propurliche for to speke - but he
                            schulde be blamed fore he hath itake to muche of mete and of drynke, for
                            it was in his powere to ete and drynke mesurableliche.
                        The secunde, moral vertue is not in the potencial vertue of the fyue
                            wyttes, for as the kynde potencial vertues bep no3t obedient to reson,
                            for by reule of resoun no man hap more digestioun oper lasse, noper more
                            growyng oper lasse: so the fif wittes bien not obedient to resoun, for
                            it is not in manis power to se oper heitlerlich oper dymlich; and 3if
                            moral vertue folweth resoun, thanne vertue is not in fife wittes.
                        The pridde, moral vertue is not in the fif wittes; for as the natural
                            potencial vertues bep fol set to here worchyng by here owne kynde, so
                            bien the wittes also. For as the fuyre heteth wip al his my3t, for it
                            worcheth by his owne kynde and is berfore noper preysed noper iblamed,
                            noper perinne is moral vertue: so for the potencial vertue of digestioun
                            makep as gret digestioun as he may, and the eyze seeth as moche as he
                            may, perinne may no moral vertue be iset. For by natural vertue,
                            potencial vertue is iset awork atte folle by here owen kynde and nedep
                            berfore no moral vertue. And so moral vertue is not in natural potencial
                            vertue, noper in potencial vertues of the fife wittes; and oper
                            potencial vertues ben pere nou3t bute the intellectualle vertu that is
                            the vnderstondyng and the appetite sensytyue and intellectiue. Thanne |
                            in soche potencial vertues mot be moral vertues.
